# Sales Performance Analytics Challenge

## Background
You're working for a company that is trying to make sense of a sales team that tracks various activities (calls, demos, meetings, etc.) on a monthly basis. The team needs deeper insights into performance trends and actionable recommendations.

## Data Description
The dataset contains monthly sales activities for each team member, comparing the current month to the previous month. Activities include:
- Outbound calls and emails
- Demo meetings (set and completed)
- Discovery meetings
- LinkedIn outreach
- Pipeline activities
- Personal development

## Challenge Tasks

1. Data Analysis & Insights
   - Analyze activity patterns and their correlation with success metrics (demos, opportunities)
   - Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that best predict successful outcomes
   - Develop a scoring system to evaluate sales rep efficiency

2. Machine Learning Component
   - Build a model to predict which activities are most likely to lead to demo completions
   - Create a recommendation system for optimal activity mix
   - Implement anomaly detection for unusual performance patterns

3. Visualization & Reporting
   - Design an interactive dashboard for sales managers
   - Create automated alerts for significant performance changes
   - Develop a clear, actionable monthly summary report

4. Bonus: AI Enhancement
   - Implement NLP for extracting insights from activity descriptions
   - Develop an AI agent that can answer questions about the data - you can leverage chatgpt or claude
   - Create personalized coaching recommendations based on performance patterns
